## 💡 Why Reputation Matters

In the fast-moving world of smart contract security, **reputation is built on results**.

Top audit firms:
- Prevent exploits across hundreds of codebases  
- Offer clear and actionable feedback  
- Are trusted by institutions to protect billions in value  

With dozens of firms claiming expertise, founders must separate **marketing from track record**.

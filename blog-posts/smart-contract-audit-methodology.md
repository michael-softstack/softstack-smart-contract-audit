# Smart Contract Audit Methodology Explained  
*How Softstack Delivers End-to-End Protection for DeFi, Stablecoins, and Web3 Protocols*

Security breaches in Web3 are growing fast. In a single year, DeFi exploits alone caused over $2 billion in losses. These hacks often stem from logic flaws, overlooked access controls, or unsafe integrations that an audit could have prevented.

If you're building a protocol, a thorough and reliable audit process is critical. Not all audits are equal. At Softstack, our methodology is designed to uncover both surface-level bugs and deep architectural risks. This guide explains how we secure smart contracts through a structured, multi-layered approachâ€”trusted by clients like Ripple, Siemens, HAL Privatbank, and BitGo.

## 1. Discovery and Scoping

Every audit begins with understanding your codebase and defining what we will evaluate:

- Collect repositories, test suites, and deployment scripts  
- Identify third-party libraries and on-chain dependencies  
- Define scope: contracts, lines of code, critical logic  
- Confirm deliverables, timelines, and communication flow  

---

## 2. Automated Vulnerability Analysis

Our auditors use a range of tools to detect common weaknesses early:

- **Slither** and **MythX** run over 1,000 checks in minutes  
- Dependencies are scanned for outdated or vulnerable packages  
- **Solidcheck** performs AI-powered scans and GitHub-integrated vulnerability discovery

## 3. Manual Code Review

Tooling is powerful, but manual review catches the most dangerous risks:

- Line-by-line logic inspection of every contract  
- Focused analysis of access control, fees, token mechanics, and admin roles  
- Manual reviews identify up to **70% of critical issues** missed by automation  

---

## 4. Security Research and Attack Simulation

We model real-world attack scenarios to stress test your code:

- Forked mainnet simulations: flash loans, MEV, oracle spoofing  
- Governance takeovers and admin permission escalations  
- Liquidity drain and slippage testing under heavy load  

---

## 5. Formal Verification (Optional but Recommended)

For mission-critical DeFi or stablecoin modules:

- Mathematical validation of logic using **Certora**, **Scribble**, and others  
- Verifies that properties like access controls and balances behave as expected  
- Often used to certify AMMs, lending protocols, and regulatory components  

---

## 6. Audit Reporting and Remediation

You receive a clear, structured, and actionable report:

- Issues ranked by severity: critical, medium, low, informational  
- Each finding includes:
  - Technical description  
  - Risk assessment  
  - CVSS score and exploit scenario  
  - Code fix recommendation  
- Followed by a live walkthrough session with our team  

---

## 7. Fix Verification and Certification

Once you implement our recommendations:

- We re-audit changed code and rerun tests  
- Manual validation confirms the resolution of each issue  
- You receive a **final certification letter** for compliance, investors, and listings  

---

## 8. Ongoing Security Monitoring

Security is not a one-time event. We offer long-term protection via:

- Mini-audits for new deployments, parameter changes, or feature additions  
- Bug bounty support via platforms like Immunefi  
- On-chain monitors for suspicious activity, upgrade proposals, or governance events

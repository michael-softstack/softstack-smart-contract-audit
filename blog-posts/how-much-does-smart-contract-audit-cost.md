# How Much Does a Smart Contract Audit Cost in 2025?

Smart contracts power DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, and the future of finance. But with innovation comes risk. In 2022 alone, over **$3.8 billion** was lost due to smart contract vulnerabilities. 

In this guide, we break down the **real cost of a smart contract audit**, what influences pricing, and why it is non-negotiable for serious Web3 teams.

## What Affects Audit Pricing?

- **Codebase size and complexity**
- **Project type** (e.g. token vs bridge)
- **External dependencies**
- **Urgency**
- **Reputation of the audit firm**
